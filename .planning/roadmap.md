# Charta PWA - Development Roadmap

This document outlines the high-level roadmap for improving the Charta PWA, tailored for a carpentry workshop's fieldwork constraints. 

The project is divided into 3 distinct phases, scaled by necessity. For detailed requirements and testing plans for each specific feature, refer to the individual phase documents below.

## [Phase 1: Core Reliability](./phase1.md)
*Immediate priority. Ensures the app functions reliably under terrible field conditions (no internet, large files).*
- Client-Side Image Compression
- Offline-First Upload Queue (Background Sync)

## [Phase 2: Organization & Workflow](./phase2.md)
*Second priority. Reduces manual labor required to sort and manage documents in the system.*
- Bulk Assignment UI
- Contextual Auto-Tagging & Grouping (via EXIF data)
- Status Flags
- Obra Sub-folders (Rooms)

## [Phase 3: Communication Enhancements](./phase3.md)
*Final priority. Upgrades the app to actively replace messaging platforms by providing rich context sharing.*
- Deep Linking / Direct Sharing
- Image Annotations (Canvas Drawing)
- Voice Memos tied to Images
